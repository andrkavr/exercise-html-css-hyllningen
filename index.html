            Linus Benedict Torvalds (born 28 December 1969) is a
            Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and lead
            developer of the Linux kernel. He also created the distributed
            version control system Git. He was honored, along with Shinya
            Yamanaka, with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the
            Technology Academy Finland "in recognition of his creation of a new
            open source operating system for computers leading to the widely
            used Linux kernel." He is also the recipient of the 2014 IEEE
            Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award and the 2018 IEEE Masaru
            Ibuka Consumer Electronics Award. Torvalds was born in Helsinki,
            Finland, the 28th December 1969, the son of journalists Anna and
            Nils Torvalds,[6] the grandson of statistician Leo TÃ¶rnqvist and of
            poet Ole Torvalds, and the great-grandson of journalist and soldier
            Toivo Karanko. His parents were campus radicals at the University of
            Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking
            minority in Finland.
